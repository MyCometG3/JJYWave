# JJYAudioGenerator Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
The JJYAudioGenerator has been refactored from a large monolithic class (~570 lines) into a modular architecture with focused components. This improves maintainability, testability, and follows the Single Responsibility Principle.

## New Architecture

### Components Created

#### 1. JJYClock Protocol & SystemClock
- **Purpose**: Abstract time access for testability
- **Benefits**: Allows dependency injection of mock clocks for testing
- **Interface**: `currentDate()`, `currentHostTime()`, `hostClockFrequency()`

#### 2. JJYFrameService
- **Purpose**: Frame construction, logging, and leap second logic
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Build JJY time frames with proper BCD encoding
  - Handle leap second calculations
  - Log frame details for debugging
- **Benefits**: Isolated frame logic can be tested with mock time

#### 3. AudioEngineManager  
- **Purpose**: Manage AVAudioEngine and hardware sample rate
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Setup and manage AVAudioEngine and AVAudioPlayerNode
  - Handle hardware sample rate configuration
  - Schedule audio buffers
- **Benefits**: Audio concerns separated from timing logic

#### 4. JJYScheduler
- **Purpose**: Timer scheduling, drift detection, and resync policy
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Manage DispatchTimer for precise timing
  - Detect timing drift and resynchronize
  - Coordinate frame rebuilding at minute boundaries
- **Benefits**: Complex timing logic isolated and testable

### Refactored JJYAudioGenerator
- **New Role**: Coordinator that orchestrates the components
- **Reduced Complexity**: From ~570 lines to ~320 lines
- **Maintained API**: All existing public methods preserved for backward compatibility
- **Improved Delegation**: Uses JJYSchedulerDelegate pattern for clean separation

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Improved Testability
```swift
// Before: Hard to test timing logic
// After: Can inject mock clocks
let mockClock = MockClock(date: specificTestDate)
let frameService = JJYFrameService(clock: mockClock)
let frame = frameService.buildFrame(...)
```

### 2. Better Separation of Concerns
- **Audio Engine**: Isolated in AudioEngineManager
- **Timing**: Handled by JJYScheduler  
- **Frame Logic**: Contained in JJYFrameService
- **Time Access**: Abstracted through JJYClock

### 3. Enhanced Maintainability
- Smaller, focused classes easier to understand
- Changes to one component don't affect others
- Clear interfaces between components

### 4. Future Extensibility
- Easy to add new clock implementations
- Scheduler can be extended with different policies
- Audio engine can support new formats independently

## Backward Compatibility
All existing public APIs of JJYAudioGenerator remain unchanged:
- `startGeneration()` / `stopGeneration()`
- `updateBand()`, `updateSampleRate()`, etc.
- Configuration methods and properties
- Delegate pattern unchanged

## Testing Examples
See the comprehensive test suite in the `Tests/` directory for examples of how the new architecture enables better testing with mock dependencies.

## Migration Notes
No changes required for existing code using JJYAudioGenerator. The refactoring is purely internal and maintains the same external interface.
